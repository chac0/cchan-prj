	            <h2>What Is Responsive Web Design?</h2>
	            <p>Responsive web design is a technique to design web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD. Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.
Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.</p>
	            <p>If implemted in a web site, the design fits well in the screen on different kinds of devices such as cell phone, tablet laptop and traditional desktop PC as well.</p>
	            <p>In responsive web design, prepare multiple CSSs for one HTML and switch CSS according to the screen size of the user's accessing device.</p>
	            <h2>Advantage / Disadvantage of Responsive Web Design</h2>
	            <p>Advantage is that it is not necessary to prepare two types of files for PC and smartphone. So, it makes management easier and it requires less production time.</p>
	            <p>On the other hand, disadvantage is that design flexibility will be limited. Since the HTML structure is the same between PC and smartphone, basically it will be expressed in the same design.</p>
	            <p>To summarize these merits and demerits,<br />
				<br />
				【merit】<br />
				<br />
				    Easy because it is a single file (less effort)<br />
				    Google recommendations (not to say strongly as SEO)<br />
				    File does not overlap<br />
				<br />
				【Demerit】<br />
				<br />
				    The degree of freedom of design drops<br />
				    The display on the smartphone may become heavy<br />

				Consider those carefully  before creating responsive web site.</p>
